Challonge Bot made to easily register, check in and unregister for tournaments on Challonge.

All made using Python requests, BeautifulSoup and pickle.

To-do:
- Integrate into a discord bot to allow various communities (especially the FGC) to easily manage signups to events.
- Allow for check-ins and unregistering
- Allow to show the rules of the event
- Potentially be able to create simple double-elim brackets for FGC events

How to use:
1) Replace the placeholders in "login.txt" with your own login details. For example: deviance@gmail.com:qwerty123:deviance69
2) Run the bot and paste in the Challonge link
3) You should be all signed up and ready to go!
